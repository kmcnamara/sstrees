This directory contains all the python scripts used to control the work flow
for all the prediction, alignment, and tree drawing software used in this
project.

These scripts all accept a list of filenames for the <b>.pdb</b> files of
structures to be analyzed. And, for output they generate a comma-separated
distance matrix to be passed along to the tree drawing program.
