    <h2>About</h2>
    <h4>Brief Background</h4>
    <p><b>Traditionally, phylogenetic trees based on sequence
       alignment are the go-to tool for analyzing comparisons between proteins
       in a set of interest. These trees are especially useful for giving
       insight into the evolutionary hierarchy of the set of proteins. Adding
       phylogenetic trees based on structure alignment into the mix provides
       an alternative perspective for analysis. Trees based on structure
       reflect the differences and similarities in the shape and fold of the
       proteins. With the mantra "structure determines function" in mind, the
       structure based trees can give insight into how proteins relate to each
       other based on function. The structure based tree is not meant to be
       a replacement for sequence based tree but rather an alternative tool,
       with a different basis, for use in comparing and contrasting the
       evolutionary and functional characteristics of proteins.</b></p>
    <h4>TL;DR</h4>
    <p><b>SVS is a protein comparison tool that utilizes both sequence alignment
       and structure alignment to produce two potentially different
       phylogenetic trees.</b></p>
    <h4>How To Use SVS</h4>
    <p><b>On the analysis page, simply enter a list of PDB IDs and a project
    title and hit submit. Next, you are presented with a list of structural
    alignment algorithms to choose from. And, you can choose which chains to
    include from the proteins entered initially. After hitting submit, the
    algorithm will take some minutes to run (potentially many if a large
    number of proteins/chains are requested). Finally, you are presented with
    two image files, one for the structure-based tree and one for the
    sequence-based tree.</b><br><br><b>
    While you can select which structure alignment algorithm to use to produce
    the structure-based tree, the sequence-based tree is always produced
    using ClustalW.
